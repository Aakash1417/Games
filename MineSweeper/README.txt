Description:
A maze that generates randomly in front of your eyes and your can play throughthe maze, I made this with Javascript and HTML, CSS.

How the program works:
-Once started the program generates a maze by moving randomly and once it hits either the edges or an already created path, itwill back track until it finds another path to take off in adn keeps repeatign this process.
-The player can start moving with the arrow keys to move left, right, up, and down
-Once the player reaches the bottom right cornor of the grid the game ends and the player Wins!!
