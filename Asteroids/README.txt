Description:
This is a simple asteroid space shooter game I made with Javascript and HTML, CSS.

How To Play:
Movement: Use the Up and Down to move back and forth, and use the Left and Right arrow keys to turn right and left.
Shoot: Use the Space Bar to shoot, holding down the Space Bar will not shoot the bullets.

Gameplay:
The objective of the game is to shoot the randomly generated asteroid and survive by moving around, the asteroid opnce gone off screen will come back with a different velocity later. You as the player can also go beyond hte screens to just koop around and come back to game play.
Once a bullet hits an asteroid the asteroid splits into two and moves in random directions (very unpredictable).
Once all the asteroids are destroyed, You Win!!
