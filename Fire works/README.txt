Description:
This is an eye pleasing display of fireworks randomly appearing on screen and bursting, I made with Javascript and HTML, CSS.

How the program works:
-The firworks are shot with an initial velocity at a random angle and there is gravity invollved with them.
-The simulation runs at a lower fps to simulate the fading of the fireworks passing by.
-Each firework is built with a particle and it explodes when the y-velocity hits 0 and fades out with a hundred new particles
